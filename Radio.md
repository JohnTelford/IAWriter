My radio journey commenced with the family multi band radio that included some amateur radio and foreign broadcast bands. I particularly enjoyed listening to Voice of America, South American, Australian, and others short wave stations. Listening to amateur radio bands also piqued my interest.


Learning about basic radios. Transmitters, and antennas at the city library, and building a crystal radio able to receive local AM signals without external power.

## Licensing

Studying and passing FCC tests for novice and general amateur radio licenses, with a focus on Morse Code practicing reception and transmission using a homemade transistor audio oscillator and Morse key.

## Commercial License

My next endeavor was to prepare for and take the Federal Communications Commission test for a First Class Commercial license. This license is essential for individuals responsible for operating and maintaining broadcast transmitters, particularly in roles such as chief engineer at a broadcast station or in work related to television transmitters.
